I have referred this from stack overflow

If a source code randomly crashes and never crashes in the same place, it could be due to a variety of reasons such as memory leaks, 
uninitialized variables, buffer overflows, race conditions, or hardware issues. To isolate the cause of the crash, we can use a debugger 
to analyze the crash dump and identify the location of the crash. We can then examine the code at that location and look for any suspicious 
code patterns such as null pointer dereferences, out-of-bounds array accesses, or uninitialized variables. We can also use tools such as 
Valgrind or Application Verifier to detect memory errors and other issues.

If the crash is still not reproducible, we can try to add more debug statements to the code to gather more information about the state of 
the program at the time of the crash. We can also try to run the program on different platforms or with different inputs to see if the crash
is related to a specific environment or input.

Bonus: computer architecture is a fascinating subject that deals with the design and organization of computer systems.
It encompasses topics such as instruction set architecture, memory hierarchy, pipelining, and parallelism. At a high level, computer architecture
is concerned with the performance, efficiency, and reliability of computer systems.

One interesting topic in computer architecture is cache coherence, which is the problem of maintaining consistency between multiple caches 
in a shared-memory system. Cache coherence is important for ensuring that all processors in the system have a consistent view of memory and 
for avoiding data races and other synchronization issues. There are many techniques for implementing cache coherence, such as snooping,
directory-based coherence, and hybrid schemes.
